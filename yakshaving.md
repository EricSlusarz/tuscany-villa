This is the yak shaving Markdown poriton of the project. I'm not sure what to put here but the project will involve making a website using what we have sort of learned this week.

We will make a basic HTML index.html and use the <header> and footer type tags.

Bootstrap  will also be used to develop the mobile version first. Make sure the layout is responsive so we test it in diffrent ways.
Custom style sheets may be added later

Maybe do a :hover

Look at the mockups and design around that.

Use the color finder in the inspector to find the color

Use google fonts
